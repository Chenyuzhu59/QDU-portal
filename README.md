# QDU-portal
A smart portal for learning and living in QDU based on WeChat mini program.
It was developed by me and two of my friends——Miss LI and Mr. ZHANG.

## Development purpose
QDU-portal integrates the information and functions of many official websites of QDU, so that it allows students to **use only one app to find all the information about campus.**
We believe our app will provide students of QDU with **great convenience in study and campus life.**
